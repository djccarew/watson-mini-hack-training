# Watson Mini Hack Training
====================================

This project is used to support  Watson  training sessions at various clients conducted by IBM Developer Advocates. Because this is a public repo, it contains no client specific information. Note however that  the content may be updated over time to support different training sessions. It is  therefore recommended that you clone  the project at the time of your training session so the material will match the agenda of your session.


## Watson Services Guide for Developers

The [Watson Services Guide for Developers](WatsonServicesGuideForDevelopersV2.0.pdf) is a summary of the information presented at the training session. It contains links to relevant information and resources and has a one page summary of each Watson API.


## Labs

These are the instructions and all supporting files for the hands-on-lab exercises.

The hands on lab exercises are:

### Lab 1 - Watson Assistant (formerly Watson Conversation)
In this lab, you will familiarize yourself with the Watson Assistant service tooling by developing a chatbot from  scratch and then extending an existing chatbot.

Follow the instructions at the link below to complete the lab.

### Lab 2 - Watson Visual Recognition
Use the Watson Visual Recognition service to train and test a classifier that can recognize wedding pictures. This could be used to analyze social media to identify customers that may respond to certian offers that are better suited to married couples. 


#### 2.1 Clone the following git repository to your local system.

#### 2.2 Follow the instructions in the repo's [README.md](https://github.com/djccarew/watson-vr-custom-classifer-lab) file to complete the lab.


### Lab 3 - Watson NLU and Watson Tone Analyzer
In this lab you'll use a combination of Watson Tone Analyzer and Watson NLU to identify highlights of the  transcripts of an earnings call. The presenters of earnings call typically try to make the calls as positive  as possible so using Tone Analyzer to find the statements  that have the highest score for joy is a good way to screen the  transcript for the most positive highlights. Once you have these sentences identified you run them through NLU to get the most relevant keywords to identify the topics covered in each  positive statement. 

#### 3.1 Clone the following git repository to your local system.
